The 'laboratory' is a place for small or experimental projects.
Many larger or longer-term projects have gotten their start here before moving to their own repositories or being merged in with something else.
On the other hand, aging and little-used projects sometimes come here to retire.
It's a mixed bag.  Here is a partial list of stuff in the laboratory (as of 2013-02-23, via [Extend-o-Brain](https://github.com/joshsh/extendo)):
