/*
  Test program for a color LED.
  
  For use with the BL-L515 Round Type, FULL COLOR LED lamp (common anode).
  Connect R, G, B pins of the LED to (PWM) digital out pins 9, 10, and 11,
  respectively, and connect the anode (long pin) to ground through a
  100Î© resistor.
  The green and blue pins of the LED may be reversed w.r.t. the datasheet.
  Note: this LED is more commonly wired with separate resistors for each of
  the color pins (rather than a single resistor for the anode).
  The one-resistor configuration simpler, although technically it exposes
  the red LED component to higher than recommended voltage.  It also requires
  you to compensate for the "overpowering" red in the code (see RED_FACTOR).
