"According to an English university research it does not matter in which sequence the letters in a word are written. The only thing that is important is that the first and the last word are in the right place. The rest of the letters can be placed at random and it will still be possible to read normally what it says. The reason fot this is that we are not reading every letter but the word as a whole."
