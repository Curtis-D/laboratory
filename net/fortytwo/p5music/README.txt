Simple P5 gestural music demo, by Joshua Shinavier

This demo maps the position and finger flexion inputs of the Essential Reality
P5 data glove to a simple musical output space.  Each finger is associated with
an audio sample which plays at a frequency inversely proportional to the glove's
distance from the detector.  The gain of each sample is determined by the degree
of flexion of the corresponding finger: open your hand to "let out" the sound.

The demo is built on top of a Max/MSP patch by Michael F. Zbyszynski
(mikezed@mac.com).  The variable-frequency looping technique was inspired by an
Isadora patch by Nicholas Chase (nick@nicholaschase.net).
