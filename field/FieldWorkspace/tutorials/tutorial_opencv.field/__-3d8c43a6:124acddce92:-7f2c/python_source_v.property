string># here we make a mesh
mesh = dynamicMesh()

# connect it to the shader
shader << mesh

# we put a square in it
with mesh:
	mesh ** Vector3(0,0,0)
	mesh ** Vector3(1,0,0)
	mesh ** Vector3(1,1,0)
	mesh ** Vector3(0,1,0)
	mesh ** [0,1,2, 0,2,3] 

# and we provide somethings that the shader will use for texture coordinates
aux = mesh.aux(5, 2)
aux.put([0,0,  width,0, width,height, 0,height])
