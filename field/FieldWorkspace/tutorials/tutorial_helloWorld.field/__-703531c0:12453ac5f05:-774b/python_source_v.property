# Field uses Python as its default language. So this editor usually contains Python

# Python is a dynamic language, so we can just set variables:

a = 10
print a

b = "hello"
print b

# (run the lines above by selecting them, or putting the cursor on them and pressing command-return; look for the output below)

# typing 'print' when we want to print a variable gets tired, so in Field you can just press command-/
# try it here:
a
